# Call of Duty: SCZ FoV Changer
A non-multiplayer field of view changer for various Call of Duty games.

**SCZ** stands for: **S**ingleplayer + **C**O-OP + **Z**ombies

## Compatibility

### Supported games
- Call of Duty: World at War ( singleplayer, co-op, zombies (solo & co-op) )
- Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 ( singleplayer, special ops (solo & co-op) )
- Call of Duty: Black Ops 1 ( singleplayer, zombies (solo & co-op) )

### Requirements
- Windows Vista or newer
- .NET Framework 4.5


### Anti-Cheat (VAC & PunkBuster)
All supported CoDs don't use VAC or PunkBuster in the singleplayer executables, so you should be on the safe side as long as you don't use it when cheat-secured games are running! 

**Nevertheless I am NOT responsible for any bans or damages!**


## How to use it
1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/marvinl97/CoD-SCZ-FoV-Changer/releases).
2. Start the FoV Changer and the game (the order doesn't matter) and choose your desired FoV. 
3. Keep it running because the FoV will be resetted in specific situations like respawning.
